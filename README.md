<h3> ♥ 𝓐𝓫𝓸𝓾𝓽 𝓶𝓮! ♥ </h3>
I really appreciate you for stopping by! :) I am currently studying The Odin Project curriculum to get my career as a front-end developer started. By all means, I am still very much a beginner but I am thoroughly enjoying the studying process and hope that I will make lots of amazing projects for everyone to see and use!

Well I have lots of different projects on here that come from either TOP, other websites/videos, or just simple my own ideas.
