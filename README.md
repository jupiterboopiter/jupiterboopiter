I really appreciate you for stopping by! :) I am currently studying The Odin Project curriculum to get my front-end development career started. By all means I am still very much a beginner but I am thoroughly enjoying the studying process and can't wait to gain more knowledge.
   
I have lots of random projects on here both from TOP and various other tutorials from other websites/videos.
