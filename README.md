<h3> ♥ 𝓐𝓫𝓸𝓾𝓽 𝓶𝓮! ♥ </h3>
  I really appreciate you for stopping by! :) I am currently studying The Odin Project curriculum to get my career as a front-end developer started. By all means, I am still very much a beginner but I am thoroughly enjoying the studying 
  process and hope that I will make lots of amazing projects for everyone to see and use!

  Well I have lots of different projects on here that come from either TOP, other websites/videos, or just simply my own ideas. I tend to go back to random projects and just readjust or clean stuff up whenever I'm bored. But obviously,     GitHub is an amazing platform where I hope to get a good job out of and simply just being in my own little coding world. <3

  <h3>༄ 𝓜𝓸𝓻𝓮 𝓪𝓫𝓸𝓾𝓽 𝓶𝓮! ༄</h3>
  <p>I am generally a pretty introverted person and I love all things creative! Some of my other hobbies include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Making and selling gel press on nails that I make and draw nail art on myself. I've always loved doing my nails as a kid.</li>
    <li>I grew up gaming and it never left me as I still often play lots of games. Mainly on the PC or even lots of VR gaming!</li>
    <li>Decorating and even making my own decorations for my room and rest of the house. I'm a pretty big fan of maximalism on my walls and just all things cute and colorful. <3</li>
  </ul>
